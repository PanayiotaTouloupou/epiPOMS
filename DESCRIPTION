Description: A collection of tools for simulating and analysing partially observed multi-
    strain (POMS) epidemic data. The epidemic models considered are discrete-time 
    individual based multi-state models describing the transmission dynamics of an 
    infectious disease among a population of individuals partitioned into groups. The
    package provides tools for performing Bayesian inference in this model class.
