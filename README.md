# epiPOMS

A collection of tools for simulating and analysing partially observed multi-strain (POMS) epidemic data. The epidemic models considered are discrete-time individual based multi-state models describing the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease among a population of individuals partitioned into groups. The R package provides tools for performing Bayesian inference in this model class.
